# HeartDiseaseDetection

MATLAB implementation of an Heart Disease Detection system.


## About the project

The main objective of this project is the development and comparison of Machine Learning models able to detect heart disease. 
The developed models are Logistic Regression from scratch and Support Vector Machine for classification, and K-Means Clustering from scratch for clustering. All the models performance have been compared both with and without the employment of Principal Component Analysis as Data Preparaion step for Dimensionality Reduction.


## Run locally

Run my project locally following these simple steps:

*  Clone the repo:

```sh
git clone https://<img width="568" alt="image" src="https://github.com/angelacassanelli/HeartDiseaseDetection/assets/80519365/e6ffbf4a-5c89-40e1-885a-75aa9e0c4910">
github.com/angelacassanelli/HeartDiseaseDetection.git
```

* Open `Main.m` in MATLAB and run it.
